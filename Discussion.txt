Zecrus: hello
puhrjj: Sup
Zecrus: are you planning on coming to terre haute for homecoming?
puhrjj: this weekend or is it next?
Zecrus: I think its this weekend
puhrjj: not sure yet budget is a bit tight
Zecrus: still no luck in finding a job?
puhrjj: not at the moment I have an interview tomorrow and two that I am waiting to hear back from
Zecrus: for this past month I have been designing and programming a game
Zecrus: Its an incremental civilization builder, which I plan on eventually making a phone app
Zecrus: the problem is that I currently have everything programmed in labview, so at some point I will need to convert it to a more accessable language
puhrjj: how far are you into development and any thing that I might be able to help with?
Zecrus: do you have access to labview?
puhrjj: not to labview but java and android sdk
Zecrus: I think if this has a chance of being a successful game, I would be willing to pay someone to reprogram the game so it can run on andriod or iOS
Zecrus: android*
puhrjj: I can take a look at porting it if you would want but probably at a casual pace and it would be intersting to see how it would work
Zecrus: that would be very helpful
puhrjj: if you want to send me something to work on my email was changed to charter
Zecrus: whats your new email?
puhrjj: jjpuhr@charter.net
Zecrus: sent you the coee I have
Zecrus: code*
Zecrus: I remember torrenting labview for this computer, I might be able to find the torrent link
puhrjj: hasn't arrived yet how big is the file?
Zecrus: sent it again, but for some reason its not showing up in my sent email folder
Zecrus: 412kb
puhrjj: that should be fine
Zecrus: sent it from my other email
Zecrus: did you get it?
puhrjj: yes my computer was being difficult or my phone was locking my email but i have 3 copies of it now
Zecrus: I have a basic functional UI set up, but I will probably need to explain a few things when you test it out
puhrjj: did you find that labview link?
Zecrus: can't seem to find the link I used
puhrjj: I found something from NI that I might be able to use
Zecrus: I know that I downloaded NI Labview 2013 32&64bit and Toolkits.iso
puhrjj: TPB?
Zecrus: just realized that I can't find the link I used since I was in private browsing
puhrjj: Paranoia screwing everyone over
Zecrus: and I used a vpn while torrenting
puhrjj: is there a chance you can send me a text version of the code like if you copied and pasted the source code from within lab view
Zecrus: I don't know if I can
puhrjj: is it all block diagram
Zecrus: yeah
puhrjj: How complex is the block diagram?
Zecrus: very
puhrjj: I might use the LabView eval for now and use that to take a look
Zecrus: sent you a picture of it
puhrjj: I might be able to work with this can you send me a picture of the GUI
puhrjj: or is it all on the backend and you need a GUI yet
Zecrus: currently creating pictures of the GUI, need to make a seperate image for each tab
Zecrus: sent you the picture of the GUI
puhrjj: So all information all the time
Zecrus: I have all the vital information outside of the tabs, ideally most of it would appear on hovering
Zecrus: the UI will definately be simplified later on
puhrjj: if you keep the percision low  like 3 sig figs it would be easy to express the values in java/android like "Food: 1.23kg" which would give enough info and have a tool tip show up with the percise value on hover or button press
Zecrus: seems like a good way to shrink the interface
Zecrus: and all the resource/s values would be on hover over as well
Zecrus: In the game, the 4 main resources the player would focus on are land, food, people, and dissent
Zecrus: each person costs 100 food and has an upkeep of 1 food/s, if you go down to -100 food you start losing people
Zecrus: dissent is mainly dependent on your government type, and acts as a soft limit to your population, it can be decreased by small amounts in many ways as your civilization improves
Zecrus: Food production is based on your hunters and permanent land
Zecrus: your land can only support a certain number of hunters, and after that they stop producing food
Zecrus: Conquered land is generated by having warriors, and conquered land gives tribute, and converts to permanent land
Zecrus: early game is all about balancing the amount of warriors and hunters you have
puhrjj: Is this assuming infinite land and the only civilization or will civ's ghandi be so many units of land away
Zecrus: I have the military abstracted, so there aren't any enemy civilizations yet
Zecrus: basically each warrior can hold 1km^2 of land, and warriors have diminishing returns
Zecrus: 'force projection'
puhrjj: any random encounters
Zecrus: not yet, not sure if I want that feature
puhrjj: or bountiful/arid land that last has a half-life and converts to normal land
Zecrus: conquered land diminishes at 0.1% per second
Zecrus: 1% per second
puhrjj: so essentially the bountiful land full of tribute
Zecrus: sort of
Zecrus: think of conquered land like colonies
puhrjj: does having too few warriors cause premant land to fall?
Zecrus: permanent land never decreases
Zecrus: but the rate that it grows slows as you get more of it
Zecrus: if you have no warriors, you won't have conquered land, and your permanent land won't grow
puhrjj: how does the tiered sciences impact the game? are there limits to each tier or can a player add more to each tier as time moves on?
Zecrus: each level of science costs 1000*(10^n)*(2^m)
Zecrus: n is the level of that science, m is the number of sciences you already have in that level
Zecrus: the reason for m is to make it so the player doesn't just fill out rows of research at a time
Zecrus: so you can focus on one type of research, and have it be 2 levels higher than another type
Zecrus: I currently have them maxed out at level 10
puhrjj: so 100 total sciences to get and they each have a linear benefit for each teir
Zecrus: 70
Zecrus: the bonuses aren't entirely linear, physics improves science and engineering generation by 10% per level
Zecrus: so 3 levels means a 33.1% bonus
Zecrus: military science level 1 changes the military from (x+100)^1/2 to (x+100)^1/1.95
Zecrus: when you get to high levels that becomes very powerful
Zecrus: economics and governance are linear so far
puhrjj: does starvation cull the population evenly or takes solders and farmers first/greater due to higher activity
Zecrus: due to how its coded right now, it takes the population evenly
Zecrus: since the jobs are calculated at the start of each tick
Zecrus: I'll explain how the governments work now
Zecrus: Basically, the governments fall under 3 trees, the democracy tree, the empire tree, and the oligarchy tree
Zecrus: the democracy tree has a weaker army, but gets large bonuses to permanent land expansion, and gets bonuses to populist buildings
Zecrus: the oligarchy tree gets a large bonus to military, but has a very low rate of permanent land expansion
Zecrus: so their economy ends up focusing on military and tribute
Zecrus: currently, I have the empire tree focused on having cheap buildings, so they can have very developed empires
Zecrus: I want to have all 3 government trees have very different playstyles, giving the game some replayability
puhrjj: so maybe have different government trees upgrades that change how each of resources grow. like in so the oligarcy would have the different ages avalible to change
puhrjj: *age of empires
puhrjj: so early ages would be focused on food  but would then slide towards military might in the latter ages
Zecrus: thats sort of what happens already in the game
Zecrus: early game is focuses on food and military, later on you have to focus on build points, gold, and dissent
Zecrus: as well as SP and EP
Zecrus: I'm thinking of adding production for lategame, but I haven't yet fully decided how to implement it
Zecrus: so it currently doesn't have a use
Zecrus: the governments don't currently have their own upgrades, they just have static multipliers
Zecrus: I could add government specific upgrades, but I don't want to further increase complexity
puhrjj: maybe different government would change the type of tribute you get so empire gets people/land as tribute oligarcy  food and democracy balenced
Zecrus: I could add that, currently tribute is 1 food/km^2/s, which increases with trade level, and gold tribute is linearly dependent on trade level
Zecrus: trade level is boosted by engineering (boats, carriages, etc) and buildings (roads, harbors)
puhrjj: will food effectiveness be influnced by building (storage) and science (medicine) similarly
Zecrus: currently, I only have improvements to food production
Zecrus: I could add some food preservation technologies
puhrjj: maybe decay as well
Zecrus: food currently decays at 0.1%/s
Zecrus: mostly to prevent someone from idling for a day, then buying 50x their population and having everyone starve
Zecrus: Ideally the player would spend ~10 minutes playing the game, optimizing their civilization, getting upgrades, etc, and then check on the game in a few hours, repeat
puhrjj: maybe have a sustainable food limit where food decays slowly but above that rapidly like  sFoodL = C* permLand * preservation * Building
Zecrus: I might add that in the future, just added it to the list of suggestions
Zecrus: now to explain construction:
Zecrus: every building will have 3 levels, which represent how much they are implemented into your society
Zecrus: for roads, level 1 would be a road between every main town, level 2 would be a road to every district, and level 3 would be a road to every house
Zecrus: each building has an upkeep dependent on its level, and that upkeep increases at a very high rate, so its usually not worth it to get level 3
Zecrus: these upkeeps scale linearly with population
Zecrus: building upkeep is in either BP (build points) or GP (gold points)
puhrjj: so the player would build huts that would be later upgraded to homes then complexs, roughly
Zecrus: more like the players would build huts for the rich, then for the middle class, then for everyone
Zecrus: as you get more efficient at buildings stuff
Zecrus: I think I'll have building type upgrades just change the stats provided by a building
Zecrus: If you look at roads, they provide very nice bonuses, so a player might want to focus a large portion of their population on sustaining road level 3
Zecrus: or they can choose to utilize thier population elsewhere
Zecrus: also, buildings have an initial cost, but that cost is added to the building's invested points, so you don't have to rebuy them
Zecrus: and you can downgrade whenever you want for free
puhrjj: so can you control the amount of districts that have teir123 housing/roads
Zecrus: no, the levels affect your entire society
Zecrus: I could add fractional levels, but I think complexity is already high enough
Zecrus: the game as a whole is probably way too complex in its current state, I don't know how many players will be willing to learn everything
puhrjj: the way curb the learning would be to have upgrade gates or where things that have a large effect in the end game arent relevent until midgame
puhrjj: probably the latter considering the type of game
puhrjj: this could be accomplish through diminishing returns and very small inital value on more complex ideas
puhrjj: so housing could have a logrithmic effect and military science could have an exponential groth
Zecrus: as it is right now, very early game is just warriors and hunters, early midgame adds science, engineering, government, and construction bp, and midgame adds gold and construction gp
puhrjj: a good place to look at ideas like this would be adVenture Capitalist
Zecrus: I played through adventure capitalist when it came out, it has a good ui and a good reset mechanic
Zecrus: the upgrades are nice milestones, but the core gameplay gets very repetitive, and the forumla has been copied way too much
Zecrus: I want this game to have a very different direction from AdCap, cooker clicker, and clicker heroes
puhrjj: Im talking about the cost to speed to return of each of the services where lemonade is terrible at the start but becomes great later on
Zecrus: so I should consider having things that give resources every hour?
puhrjj: not nessarily per tick maybe but more of how the cost v net return resembles a cubic funciton with different hills and vallys
Zecrus: I think my construction mechanic sort of follows that pattern
Zecrus: you can probably ignore it for the early-mid and middle game and be fine
Zecrus: early on, you basically spend 10% of your population for a 15% bonus
Zecrus: I could shift construction entirely to midgame instead of having it start early-mid game
puhrjj: another way to think about it is add more interaction between the diffent tech trees as time goes on. military science could get and give gains based on biology at later levels
Zecrus: I have engineering that requires multiple types of science
puhrjj: eng. could get a stronger bounus as physics developes. To demystify the interaction just show the bonuses in a text box
Zecrus: physics increases engineering production by 10% per level
Zecrus: I guess I should probably swap the EP and SP income boxes with EP and SP bonus %
Zecrus: btw, any luck with downloading labview?
puhrjj: I think I might be able to do without as a pictures worth 1000 words and for how messy this is it is actually not to hard to read
puhrjj: I might be able to go straight into java/android with this
Zecrus: I really like using labview since I'm very good with visual layouts
Zecrus: how many hours do you think it would take to remake the program in java?
Zecrus: 10? 100?
puhrjj: with the small modules I conservetivly estimate an half hour each and the more complex modules 1-2hours if i include testing
puhrjj: frankly the biggest timesync would be getting the framework and the UI since you have done all of the heavy lifting with the logic
Zecrus: yeah, I have no idea how the framework and UI would be done in java, one of the main reasons I used labview
puhrjj: the UI will defenatly take time I would defenatly start in Java then migrate into android with the more confined UI. as for the framework it would be mainly declaration initialization and the running sections
Zecrus: how would saving work?
Zecrus: I guess it would save to a txt file, and use that for initialization?
puhrjj: essentiallly all the variables could be written to a file everyso often and that would record the state
Zecrus: If I double and fully balance the number of engineering inventions, buildings and government types and you recode the game and make a better UI, how well do you think the game could sell?
Zecrus: I was thinking of probably selling the game for a few dollars up front, but I'm also considering the idea of having a demo and the ability to buy the rest of the game
Zecrus: demo would go up to early mideval ages, full game would go to or past modern time
puhrjj: I couldn't be sure as there is a high level of complexity with a very barebones UI a good way to test the waters would be to host it on a site like Kong which supports monitaztion(sp)
puhrjj: that would also be a good way to advertise a mobile version
Zecrus: can you tell me if the following feature is viable?
Zecrus: A map of the world, split into many equally sized sections 1000km^2 each
Zecrus: you pick a starting location, and as you expand, random connecting sections would fill up
Zecrus: so you can see a direct coorelation between your land and your empire's size
puhrjj: I could be as you would have things be proceedurly generated to match the building and road levels
puhrjj: and the warfront could have representative solders that would show how thinly spread they are
puhrjj: it would most likely be a circular map and it would be impacted by the distant to the capital (sqrt of the permanent area)
puhrjj: and past the solders would be either forests or fog of war
Zecrus: I don't think circular expansion would really work for coastal starts
Zecrus: as to why I want random expansion into equally sized areas
puhrjj: hemicircle would work as well
Zecrus: what about starts like rome?
Zecrus: soon you would hit coast on both sides
Zecrus: I think being able to play as historical empires would add a lot to the appeal of the game
puhrjj: the hard part with having a random expansion would be keeping that consistant between loads without having the file size explode. though if you have a finite map that would not be an issue
Zecrus: the finite map would be earth's surface
Zecrus: I would have to add a hard limit to conquered and permanent land, so that it doesn't exceed 148428950.038km^2
Zecrus: though I don't know if a map with 148,428 sections could be loaded quickly
puhrjj: it doesn't have to since you would only care about the borders
puhrjj: every other grid would either be 'yours' or not 'yours' and generated and forgotten when you have sight of it
Zecrus: That seems like a good implementation
puhrjj: you could have certain sections display like capitols and your first location would be the epic
Zecrus: could areas that are in contact with multiple areas you own have a much higher probability of being chosen for expansion, so you don't end up with fractal-like countries?
puhrjj: that would work you would have it choose the next one by probability based from the border and when two are enclosing they would have a twice chance and if there is one forgotten it would have 4 the chance or
Zecrus: and coastal tiles would have a higher probability as well, for historic reasons
puhrjj: if they are on the coast just give them multipliers
puhrjj: fyi this is starting to sound like Rome Total War
Zecrus: the map would just be a cool-looking gimmick to attract players
Zecrus: and so players can show off their progress
puhrjj: for an easy start graphics wise dwarf fortress may be a good place to start
Zecrus: projected income from a phone game can be anywhere from 0-$1,000,000
Zecrus: how much of a risk would you want to take to develop this game?
Zecrus: I was thinking that, if we are the only 2 making the game
Zecrus: to offer you either 50% of profits, or 25% of profits and $1000
puhrjj: ill definatly help out and try to do as much as I can in my spare time
Zecrus: I usually spend ~1-2 hours a day on this, since I'm also currently working on my thesis
Zecrus: I'm willing to take a risk to see if developing things independently is an option, rather than finding a normal job
puhrjj: as for a break down of profits it
puhrjj: 's unclear where that would fall effortwise at this moment
Zecrus: true, the values can be changed, if it takes several hundred hours I will pay much more than $1000
Zecrus: I have ~$5000 in stocks, so thats probably my limit
Zecrus: and I might have to spend $1000 on artwork if I want some added to the game
puhrjj: Im onboard and till we have something Im ok with little to no recompense its also getting late and matters of money I would want to be fully awake to make decisions
Zecrus: fair enough
Zecrus: btw, you live ~4 hours from here, right?
puhrjj: 5 hours
Zecrus: I just have to write my thesis on my own time, so I can drive over to your house
puhrjj: when are you planning on do so?
Zecrus: any time should be fine for me
puhrjj: ok think things over and i will get cracking on th e port when I have my first chance but just to be clear I am still going to be focusing on the job search as well.
Zecrus: sounds good
Zecrus: also, could you download the trial version of labview and test out the current game?
puhrjj: yeah I will give that a shot tomorrow, and doesn't labview have a way to make things standalone
Zecrus: Since I have been testing and adjusting the game on my own, it would be useful to have a second opinion
puhrjj: check if you have access to the application builder tool
puhrjj: https://zone.ni.com/reference/en-XX/help/371361J-01/lvhowto/building_a_stand_alone_app/
Zecrus: trying to figure it out right now
Zecrus: I built a .exe, trying to attach the file now
Zecrus: ok, sent it to you
Zecrus: did you get the file?
puhrjj: yes just installing the runtime engine
Zecrus: does it work?
puhrjj: still installing
Zecrus: how large is the runtime engine?
puhrjj: I think about 300 Mb  and its installing to the C drive then transfering over to the D drive very  silly if you ask me
Zecrus: I guess that is a lot more convienient than downloading the whole program, since the .iso is 4.51gb
puhrjj: Brb got to restart
Zecrus: ok


____

Never tell your password to anyone.
Zecrus: wassup
Zecrus: any luck finding a job?
puhrjj: Didn't see you there, I'm heading off to bed soon, however I have progressed on the code some, working mainly on setting up the variables and trying to distil the setting of the variables like engineering and other tech and accumulating the progress so far I plan on using java maps or sets or tables and on the job front not so far
Zecrus: should I send you the latest version of my code?
puhrjj: sure what type of changes did you make
puhrjj: value changes should be the easiest to cope with
Zecrus: I added ~2 buildings, a lot of research, and redid the dissent balance
Zecrus: also a bunch of minor bug fixes
puhrjj: most of that I have yet to work on so that wont be a problem
Zecrus: no more assigning -10000% crafters and having 10100% of the intended workers
puhrjj: but hey the math checks out even it the people don't
Zecrus: just sent you the latest version
puhrjj: ok would you want me to throw the code up on github?
Zecrus: sure
puhrjj: https://github.com/Onering20/CivIdle
puhrjj: not uploaded yet and if you have a github account I can make it so you can upload files
Zecrus: just created an account
Zecrus: how do I get push access?
puhrjj: whats your account
Zecrus: Zecrus
puhrjj: you have been invited
puhrjj: https://github.com/Onering20/CivIdle/invitations
Zecrus: just uploaded some files
Zecrus: btw, did you play through the game so far?
puhrjj: just the bit at the start
Zecrus: I made the start a bit faster, spear 1 now costs 250EP so you can get it when you have ~50 people
Zecrus: I was thinking of adding in a production system for lategame, not yet sure how to implement it
Zecrus: I switched all the dissent modifiers from additive to multiplicative
puhrjj: so it makes the dissent worse later on
Zecrus: the opposite
Zecrus: instead of something giving a flat -5% dissent, it now will multiply your dissent by .9
puhrjj: ah with <1 values
Zecrus: so if you had 50% dissent, they both have equal effect
Zecrus: very lategame you could in theory get your dissent multiplier down to .1, so 500% dissent would become 50%
puhrjj: ok I was going with the idea from the opposite side as in size of state making dissent more rampent
Zecrus: ah
Zecrus: I have all the governments set up so that dissent approximately doubles as population increases by 10x
Zecrus: uploaded the maple file that graphs each government's dissent
Zecrus: currently reading your code
Zecrus: the new method of implementing engineering seems like it will be much easier than in labview
puhrjj: yeah what i want to do with it at some point is make it pull that info from a file for easier configuration
Zecrus: I notice that there are some new research names
Zecrus: they seem good so far
puhrjj: instramentum and cognitio are kind of filler names I took from a minecraft mod called thaumcraft they are just placeholders to avoid nulls
Zecrus: the current medicine names seem too advanced for their costs
Zecrus: I should probably create an EP/SP cost to approximate year converter
puhrjj: I don't have a good idea on the tiers of anchent medicine so i approximated
Zecrus: I'll make sure to figure out a good conversion in the next few days
puhrjj: oh btw the file you are looking at has been moved to src/main
Zecrus: I assume that getting buildings to work probably will probably be the most difficult step
puhrjj: not necessarily since those are more of a active control they would be more of flags for now
Zecrus: how does each tick work?
puhrjj: I am currently planning on the all the different state based actions would be accounted for and then change the state at the end of the tick
Zecrus: my current code isn't too efficient in this regard
Zecrus: I currently have the government check every tick, which probably coudl be coded better
Zecrus: same for every dissent modifier
Zecrus: If you need to go to sleep I can talk to you later
puhrjj: right now i just want to get eclipse working with it again moving the project was not as smooth as i thought it would be
Zecrus: so far the code looks good
Zecrus: eclipse isn't working?
puhrjj: I was not liking that i change the sorce folder when I set up the github
puhrjj: I got it to recognize it though
Zecrus: from a design perspective, how many buildings do you think should be in the game?
Zecrus: since the player has to manage each one, I don't want to have nearly as many buildings as engineering inventions
puhrjj: thinking back to aoe one for each purpose
puhrjj: maybe combine likes with likes or have overlap to promote different stratagies
puhrjj: a building that gives bonus to gov and taxes vs a building that gives bonus to gov and med
Zecrus: so instead of having roads and trains etc, I would just have land infrastructure
puhrjj: possibly
Zecrus: I'm not entirely sure how to implement this, but here is my current idea:
Zecrus: construction would focus on different aspects of society: housing, infrastructure, health, education, entertainment, military, production
Zecrus: each building would be an invention, which would provide a boost to a certain construction focus
Zecrus: this might be too abstract
puhrjj: so Stables would be a invetion on a tech tree
Zecrus: basically, though I might need to add a new tree
puhrjj: play around with it but if it gets you confused then hold off until we refine it
Zecrus: maybe it would be better to just have buildings be replaced by new ones
puhrjj: like have a few aspects to focus on and they give a benifit but are limited to a small number
puhrjj: primary : full bonus, secondary: half bonus, tirtiary: quarter bonus. adding a new focus becomes primary and tirtiary falls away
Zecrus: That could be an interesting system, but I'm not really sure how that utilizes build points and gold
puhrjj: I would think unlocking the three slots would take bp and using them would have a gold upkeep
puhrjj: or every switch has a fixed bp cost
puhrjj: as in you built a new reserch building and let the others fall into disrepair
Zecrus: I'll think about it, and try to make a decision in the next few days
Zecrus: the current gameplay from buildings has tested well, mostly I just want to make sure it can work for lategame as well as early-mid
Zecrus: managing 5 BP buildings and 5 GP buildings works out well, I just need to make sure I don't end up with 50 buildings to manage
puhrjj: yeah that would become confusing at best and at worst drive players away from the complexity
Zecrus: as your civilization unlocks better building/gold collection methods, the upkeep costs of early buildings becomes comparatively small
Zecrus: it might just be enough to allow the player to hide buildings, and if there are 50 buildings the player will hide 40 of them and focus on 10
puhrjj: or have early building be incorperated/upgraded to later buildings
Zecrus: on second thought, having build upkeep become quickly irrelevant would require a fast exponential curve to earnings
Zecrus: I don't want an empire to make 10^30 gold per second
puhrjj: or you could let early buildings be abandond
puhrjj: an d have their effect fall away  ass upkeep is removed
puhrjj: touch typing is hard to keep correct
Zecrus: so I could have 50 buildings, and have the player choose 10 of them to be able to build, and the other 40 would be locked out?
puhrjj: maybe but after so many years/ticks the buildings are considered removed
puhrjj: 'you just built a castle do you still want to maintain the first mud hut?'
Zecrus: but then where do the peasants live?
puhrjj: the mines
Zecrus: I think I'll just have buildings upgrade into new ones.  Researching brick houses would replace the hut building with the brick house building
Zecrus: brick houses will have a higher upkeep, cost, and better bonuses
Zecrus: and a revert option would be added
Zecrus: huts automatically get abandoned once brick houses are available
puhrjj: we should keep the other idea in mind in case we wont to add a function to construction as maintaince points
puhrjj: based on how many contruction workers
Zecrus: thats what BP upkeep is
Zecrus: I currently have half of my buildings use build point upkeep, and the other half use gold upkeep
Zecrus: early-mid game you will probably keep 5-20% of your workers as builders in order to maintain the BP upkeep
puhrjj: otherwiise the town falls apart'
Zecrus: currently going into BP debt is the same as going into gold debt, and it raises dissent
Zecrus: I think I'll switch that to a system where buildings automatically turn off
puhrjj: probably rebalence it where its half dissent and half production hit
Zecrus: but I don't want someone lategame to have a slight BP or gold deficit and go from 50% dissent to 200% when everything turns off
Zecrus: 200% automatically caps to 99%, so there isn't negative production
puhrjj: maybe for every year or so in defict raises the impact of the defict
Zecrus: In an older version going over 100% dissent would cause you to have negative production, get higher dissent, and quickly have you get -inf% dissent and crash the game
puhrjj: maybe have a bp floor that is like 40-50% current maximum
Zecrus: The current system has dissent added based on (gold debt + BP debt)/population, maxing out at 20%
Zecrus: I can see this being abused if a player is willing to get 20% debt, and sets all buildings to max level
Zecrus: I don't want to punish players who went afk with a minor deficit, but I don't want an abusable system
puhrjj: maybe have debt thresholds that prevent certain actions
Zecrus: no researching or increasing population if you have too much debt?
puhrjj: maybe no researching and building, people will breed if the dwplease
puhrjj: force it into a situation that enables growth out of debt
Zecrus: I guess that isn't abusable, the player can't stock up a large EP/SP bonus from purposely going into massive debt and use it
Zecrus: I
Zecrus: I'll implement it in the next build
puhrjj: ok I think im going to head off soon, just so you know I have been keeping a log of this discussion for idea review on  the github under discussion.txt
Zecrus: nice, that will be useful
puhrjj: probably should trim it at some point there is a lot of banter in there
Zecrus: btw, will you be on steam more often?
puhrjj: I generally keep steam running how ever with warframe i get better performance with the overlay off
Zecrus: I'll create a new build in the next few days and post it
Zecrus: I'll make sure to have an EP cost to year converter, lock research for players in debt, and add some replacement buildings
puhrjj: ok try to get a picture of the diagram as well so I can check for changes, and if you know what to change in the java file you can edit directly on git hub just follow your changes with "//TODO check" and that will alert me that changes were made and to make sure they do what is intended
Zecrus: actually, I probably won't add the debt lock since I would have to change every module, its too late to implement it in the labview code
puhrjj: that might be easier to do in java anyways
Zecrus: making the pictures now
Zecrus: 7010x7314 pixels
puhrjj: windows 7 photo previewer doesn't like it when they are that big, however eclipse has no problem with that size
Zecrus: I put all the pictures in a branch called images
Zecrus: I thought that was a new folder
Zecrus: I get it now, a branch is a different version of the program
puhrjj: to do folders in github is weird  you have to name them "folder/file.ext"
Zecrus: I assume you can access the branch without any problems
puhrjj: yea Ill merge the branch and then put them in a folder
puhrjj: if you make a branch just click pull request and that will prompt to see if it can be merged
