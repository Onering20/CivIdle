Game should now be balanced up to around renaissance era (20M people, 10B SP/EP)
  It currently takes ~100 ingame years (36500 ticks, or 10 hours at 1tick/s) to get this far
  I expect that it will take much longer for the average player to get this far, but further balance requires other playtesters

BP building rebalance- it was too easy lategame to have level 3 of every bp building
		Hut upkeeps and build costs increased
		Road upkeeps and build costs increased, land production mod decreased
		Road land conversion buff moved from paved tar to multiplayer stone, values increased
		Aqueduct upkeep tripled
		no changes to market
		no changes to harbor
	Buff to all writing from 10% to 15%, to help compensate for building nerf
	Increase to cost of all siege weapons by 10x
		Too many inventions costed similar amounts and provided similar bonuses
		This also fits better historically
		All science requirements increased by 1 level
	Removed military requirement for trireme
	Swapped physics and military level requirement for reinforced chariot
	New inventions
		Added guns
			guns, siege weapons, and vehicles is probably all that is needed for lategame
			military.  Bioweapons could be added if biology needs more lategame support.  
		Added lots of details to engineering 3 page
		Added 2 more levels to farming
	Nerf to gold production, each economics level after the first now has half effect
  updated temple upkeep description 
	fixed: previous start was left in test mode with 10E12 starting SP
